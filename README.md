# ST7565R_Driver
Driver for Display Controllers that use the ST7565R driver

DRIVER IS STILL IN PROGRESS
Painting strings is not yet implemented

Use Vertically Oriented Bitmaps to display custom images. 
Fonts are Horizontally Oriented. 

I am using this with the NHD-C12832A1Z-FSW-FBW-3V3 screen:

Driver currently configured for STM Devices.
However; it shouldn't be too difficult to reconfigure for other platforms.

Driver is based off of a bare-bones Arduino driver from Newhaven Displays:
